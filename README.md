Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
## Three Major Steps in Software Development

### 1. The Software Crisis and the Search for Solutions

In the 1960s, creating software was a big challenge. Projects often ran over time, cost more than planned, and didn't work as expected. This made people realize that building software needed a better approach. To fix this, developers started planning software projects carefully and testing them thoroughly to make sure they worked correctly.

### 2. Building Software with Blocks: Object-Oriented Programming

Around the 1980s, programmers discovered a new way to build software using "objects." These objects were like building blocks, each with its own parts and abilities. This method made software easier to change, reuse, and understand. Programming languages like C++, Java, and Python became very popular for building software with objects.

### 3. Working Together and Adapting: The Agile Approach

In the early 2000s, a new way of making software called "Agile" became popular. Agile teams work closely together, show their work often, and are ready to change plans as needed. This approach helps teams finish projects faster, make customers happy, and deal with unexpected challenges.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
## Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The SDLC is a systematic process used to create software. It involves several phases:

1.  **Planning:** This is the initial phase where the project goals and scope are defined. It includes feasibility studies, project planning, and resource allocation.
2.  **Requirements Gathering:** In this phase, the team collects detailed information about what the software should do. This involves understanding user needs and creating specific requirements.
3.  **Design:** Based on the requirements, software architects create a blueprint of the software's structure. This includes system architecture, database design, and user interface design.
4.  **Development:** This is where programmers write the actual code based on the design specifications. The software is built using programming languages and tools.
5.  **Testing:** The software is thoroughly tested to find and fix bugs. Different testing methods like unit testing, integration testing, and system testing are performed.
6.  **Deployment:** Once the software is tested and approved, it is released into the market or deployed to users. This might involve installation, configuration, and user training.
7.  **Maintenance:** After the software is deployed, it requires ongoing maintenance to fix bugs, add new features, and improve performance.

It's important to note that these phases can overlap or be repeated depending on the specific SDLC model used (e.g., Waterfall, Agile, Iterative).

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
## Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies
